    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.splice();
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    team4[3] = 'heeeee'
    console.log(team4)

    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person , {number : 55 , age : 12})
    console.log(cap2)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
